# 3DModeler
A primitive, Blender inspired, personal project that can view (and eventually edit) OBJ files.

## Features
- Can load OBJ files and their corresponding MTL files and view objects using a first-person shooter style control scheme
- Can save changes made to OBJ files (only changes that can currently be made are adding cubes)
- Can toggle between different display options such as displaying wireframe, shading, and/or textures

### Coming Soon
- Adjustable viewport background colour
- Adjustable field of view
- Adjustable pixel width/height
- Selectable objects
- Transformations (scaling, translating, rotating) of objects
- Deletion of objects
- Addition of shapes such as cones, cylinders, and spheres
- Processing material template library data (other than just the texture file)

## Camera Controls
- "W" moves the camera forward
- "S" moves the camera backward
- "A" turns the camera leftward
- "D" turns the camera rightward
- "R" turns the camera upward
- "F" turns the camera downward
- "O" moves the camera along the positive y-axis
- "L" moves the camera along the negative y-axis
- "K" moves the camera along the positive x-axis
- ";" moves the camera along the negative x-axis
